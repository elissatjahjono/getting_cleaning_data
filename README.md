# getting_cleaning_data
Repo for Coursera 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course project

The aim of this project is to get and clean data, and to create tidy dataset.
Tidy dataset is necessary for further data analysis.
Raw data were obtained from:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

There are three files in this repo (not including this README.md):
1. run_analysis.R, contains all the code needed to create the tidy dataset from the raw dataset
2. CodeBook.md, contains descriptions/explanations for all the variables, data, and step-by-step transformations performed in the run_analysis.R script
3. Second_Tidy_Dataset.txt, is the tidy dataset created by running the codes in the run_Analysis.R script. Descriptions on variable names can be found in the codebook.md.
